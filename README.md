# Web Scraping Python Script
I love pens, so I figured I might just write a Python script to scrape pen prices from various websites. While useful, the main goal of
this project was to sharpen my web scraping and data analysis skills.

This project currently scrapes the following websites:
- https://www.alwaysfashion.com/tr/

Other websites will be implemented in the future:
- https://www.viscontiturkey.com
- https://www.montblanc.com/en-tr
- https://lamyshop.com.tr
- https://www.markakalem.com

Certain measures are taken to ensure the servers are not exhausted.
All the data scraped in this project are publicly available, meaning 
no private data is collected.
